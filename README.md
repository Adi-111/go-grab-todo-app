## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo CLI:** Install Expo CLI if you haven’t already.

  ```sh
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

- **SQLite:** SQLite is used for local data storage. Ensure you have it configured for your project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-application.git
   cd todo-application
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Initialize the Database**

   Ensure you have the SQLite database set up and initialized. You may need to run any setup scripts or ensure that the database is correctly configured.

### Running the App

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your default browser with the Expo DevTools. You can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to run the project on your mobile device, or use an emulator/simulator.

2. **Run on Android/iOS Emulator**

   To run the app on an Android or iOS emulator:

   ```sh
   npm run android
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   npm run ios
   ```

## Code Overview

### `App.tsx`

The main entry point of the application where the navigation and global components are set up.

### `components/`

- **`add-group-modal.tsx`**: Modal for adding new groups.
- **`add-todo-modal.tsx`**: Modal for adding new todos.
- **`update-todo-modal.tsx`**: Modal for updating existing todos.
- **`themed-view.tsx`**: A view component with theme support.

### `hooks/useDb.ts`

Contains database functions for interacting with the SQLite database:

- **`getGroups`**: Fetch all groups from the database.
- **`insertTodo`**: Insert a new todo into the database.
- **`deleteTodo`**: Delete a todo from the database.
- **`updateTodoToggle`**: Update the completion status of a todo.

### `screens/`

- **`index.tsx`**: Home screen displaying the list of groups.
- **`todo-list.tsx`**: Screen displaying todos within a selected group.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database is Locked Error:** This usually occurs due to concurrent transactions. Ensure that transactions are short and avoid overlapping queries. Implement retry logic if needed.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to contribute to the development of the application.
